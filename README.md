# 🧾 retail-sales-analysis

## 📌 Overview

This project performs a complete end-to-end analysis of retail transaction data for a chain of stores. The goal is to extract actionable insights to help the business:
- Identify best-selling and most profitable products
- Understand customer behavior and preferences
- Detect delivery or operational inefficiencies
- Support data-driven business decisions

---

## 🏢 Background

The store tracks detailed sales data including:
- Customer and transaction info
- Product details (name, category, price)
- Purchase time and date
- Payment method and order status

Despite this, the business lacks clarity in key areas of performance and customer engagement.

## ❗ Problem Statement

The company is currently unable to answer critical questions such as:
- What are the most and least sold products?
- Which items bring in the most revenue?
- Which product categories have high return/cancellation rates?
- What are customer preferences based on demographics (e.g., gender, age)?
- Are there operational delays or errors affecting order delivery?
